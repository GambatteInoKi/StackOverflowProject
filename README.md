## Docker Approach

1. Copy `.env_example` to `.env` and change the values properly.
    - Adjust the values to match the one in `resources/pgadmin4/pgpass` and `resources/pgadmin4/servers.json` for pgadmin4 to work prpoerly.
2. Just run `sudo docker compose up --build`
3. Open your browser and enter "http://localhost:4200" and enjoy!


## Legacy Note

First off, use the .env_example for yopur reference and set up a local Postgres Database, and create a table called saved_questions with this command:


CREATE TABLE saved_questions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    link VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    score INTEGER NOT NULL,
    creation_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    tags VARCHAR(255),
    view_count INTEGER,
    owner VARCHAR(100)
);

The above is only an example:

What you need to do is that you have to change .env_example to .env which sets up the python environment since the constants are used in the init file.

Once you do that, you must also have docker in your machine and run docker compose up ==build in order to start the container with images that are necessary to the project.

The code will automatically create the tables as specified within init.sql which has a similar table as shown in the example above.

Make sure that you have the proper credentials in .env: if it does not work, replace the .env variables with the following:
DB_NAME=postgres
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_HOST=postgres
DB_PORT=5432

You can run the SPA project by first installing node at https://nodejs.org/en

After, make sure to install angular CLI with command prompt that can use node:
npm install -g @angular/cli

After, make sure you use the project packages with:
npm i 

This installs NgPrime which is a component library mostly for table usage.

Make sure you're in the right directory before running:
ng serve


To run the api tests, you need to run the playwright scripts.

The following is a guide to INSTALL it. People that downloaded a copy of the application do not need to install it.

The playwright scripts were installed on the root of the directories using 

npm init playwright@latest

because playwright is standalone and doesn't need a project to run as it can run by itself.
It was made with these configurations:

√ Do you want to use TypeScript or JavaScript? · TypeScript
√ Where to put your end-to-end tests? · test e2e 
√ Add a GitHub Actions workflow? (y/N) · false
√ Install Playwright browsers (can be done manually via 'npx playwright install')? (Y/n) · true

To run all the tests, run in the test e2e directory:

npx playwright test

playwright report is autogenerated so generally ignored, however the terminal should tell if all the cases passed or not.
